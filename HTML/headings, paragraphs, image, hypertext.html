  If you're having problems downloading Chrome on your Windows computer, you can
  try the alternate link below to download Chrome on a different computer. On a
  computer connected to the Internet, download the alternate Chrome installer.
  Move the file to the computer where you want to install Chrome. Open the file,
  and follow the onscreen instructions to install. If you land on the regular
  download page, thatâ€™s normal. Even though the installers look similar, a
  special tag tells us which one is best for you.
